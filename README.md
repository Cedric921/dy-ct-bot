# Daily Commit Bot

## How it works

2. Each run creates a new entry in `activity.log` with a timestamp
3. The changes are automatically committed and pushed to your repository

## Setup

2. Enable GitHub Actions in your repository settings
3. The action will automatically run on the schedule

## Manual Trigger

1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your repository

3. Clicking "Run workflow"

## Note
